### Introduction: 

**Project Goal:**

	The primary aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive and integrated system for 3D concrete printing. This system will enable simulation, real-time monitoring, and control of the printing process, ensuring optimal quality and minimizing risks.

**Detailed Explanation:** 

	The goal of this project is to dissect and develop a multifaceted printing setup for 3D concrete printing. This includes developing a simulation platform to model and test (or simulate) a 3D concrete printing session for preliminary quality control and risk & error reduction. The project also revolves around setting up and testing the limitations of various components of the physical in-Lab setup consisting of a material mixer, a 3D printer in the form of an ABB robotic arm, and a data collection tool consisting of a (…) camera. It also includes the conduction of various analyses on the materials aspect of the project such as a real-time material and print quality analysis based on surface textural pattern recognition as well as concrete layer height measurement for print anomaly detection. All the listed aid in the completion of the overall goal of the project; to develop a multifarious controller that can take the above listed analyses results as inputs and adjust the process parameters listed above in real-time as outputs to optimize the 3D concrete printing process.
